### âœ¨Elisa SuÃ¡rez, aspiring data scientist 
> Aspiring Data scientist and student based in Uruguay, passionate about data analytics, engineering and AI-powered solutions. I am eager to contribute to real-world data projects and continuously expand my skills.

## About me

- Early career: After finishing Administrative Accounting Assistant studies, I started working at a fintech company. Thatâ€™s where I decided to pivot into the Data Science world.

- 2022: Studied Data Science and Data Analytics at Coderhouse, completing a final project: creating a dashboard which showed the analysis of a data source, and a classification model predicting divorces using Logistic Regression.

- 2023: Data Engineering course: learned ETL processes, data warehousing, and SQL with Amazon Redshift.

- 2024: Started Bachelor degree in Statistics at UdelaR. This degree provides a complete training in statistical methods, both to handle their theoretical (probabilistic) properties fluently and to apply statistical and computational methods for high-quality Data Science.

- 2025: Completed Data Science III specialization at Coderhouse: Deep Learning (CNN & RNN) and NLP with Python.
- Nowadays: I am currently studying Data Science on my own, incorporating the proper use of AI, and developing data analysis and machine learning projects.

## Tech Stack

- Languages: Python, SQL
- Tools: Power BI, Excel, Git, FastAPI
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, NLP
- Other: Docker, Amazon Redshift, APIs, data visualization
